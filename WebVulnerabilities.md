*But tiktok has already Two-Factor Authentication when you have tiktok account to make sure that you have the privacy for your account, TikTok provides the option to log in with a verification code sent to your phone, but this is a one-time access code. Single-factor authentication is not uncommon on social platforms. Coupled with a weak password, this creates a possible security issue as it can lead to phishing or ransomware attacks, among other threats. Many social media platforms now offer two-factor authentication.*
